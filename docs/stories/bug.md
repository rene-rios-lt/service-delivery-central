## BUG-001 — `RepHub` is missing the force-release notification event

- **Status:** Fixed
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Repo / Area:** Backend — SignalR infrastructure (`BE-025`), Vehicles (`BE-007`)
- **Related stories:** `BE-007`, `BE-025`
- **Found:** Cross-checking backend stories against the updated frontend stories.

**Summary**
`BE-007` (force-release a vehicle) states: *"If the affected rep is online, they receive a SignalR notification via `RepHub`."* But `BE-025`'s `RepHub` event catalogue lists only `JobOfferReceived`, `JobOfferExpired`, and `RedirectReceived` — there is **no force-release / session-revoked event defined**.

**Expected**
`BE-025`'s `RepHub` publishes a session-revoked event, and `BE-007` names it.

**Actual**
No such event exists in `BE-025`; the notification `BE-007` promises has no defined event name or payload.

**Impact**
A force-released rep's client has no specified event to react to — it can't reliably clear the active job and return to vehicle selection. Implementers may omit the notification entirely because it isn't catalogued.

**Proposed fix**
- Add a `RepHub` event to `BE-025`, e.g. `VehicleForceReleased { vehicleId, byDispatcher: true, reason? }`.
- Reference that event by name in `BE-007`'s acceptance criteria.

**Acceptance criteria (bug resolved when):**
- `BE-025`'s `RepHub` row lists the force-release event with a defined payload.
- `BE-007` references the event by name.
- The event is consistent with how `FE-014` / the rep shell expect to be notified.

## BUG-002 — No frontend story for the Dispatcher force-release action

- **Status:** Fixed
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Repo / Area:** Frontend — Dispatcher (relates to `FE-006`)
- **Related stories:** `BE-007`, `FE-006`, new `FE-022`
- **Found:** Cross-checking backend stories against the updated frontend stories.

**Summary**
`BE-007` implements `POST /vehicles/{id}/force-release`, and `FE-006` (rep offline alert) narrates the dispatcher's decision — *"decide whether to force-release the vehicle or wait for the rep to reconnect."* But **no frontend story or acceptance criterion defines the UI to actually invoke force-release** (no button, no confirmation dialog).

**Expected**
A frontend story specifying the force-release action, plus a cross-reference from `FE-006`.

**Actual**
Force-release is unreachable from the UI as currently specified; the backend endpoint has no frontend consumer story.

**Impact**
A dispatcher cannot recover a stuck/offline rep's vehicle through the UI, despite the backend supporting it. The offline-alert flow (`FE-006`) dead-ends at "decide" with no follow-through.

**Proposed fix**
- Add new story **FE-022 — Force-release a vehicle (Dispatcher)** with full acceptance criteria:
  - Force-release action available from the offline-alert banner (`FE-006`) and/or the rep marker popover (`FE-003`).
  - Confirmation dialog → calls `POST /vehicles/{id}/force-release`.
  - On success: vehicle marker updates to Unclaimed/Offline; request handling reflects the re-queue.
  - Restricted to Dispatcher; Desktop + Web only (per ADR-0008).
- Cross-reference `FE-022` from `FE-006`.
- Update the Story ↔ Screen Traceability table; optionally render a force-release confirm-dialog mockup to match the "every story has a visual" pattern.

**Acceptance criteria (bug resolved when):**
- `FE-022` exists in [`frontend.md`](frontend.md) with full acceptance criteria.
- `FE-006` cross-references `FE-022`.
- Traceability table updated (and mockup rendered if that option is taken).

## BUG-003 — FE-011 cross-references the wrong story for `RedirectReceived`

- **Status:** Fixed · **Severity:** Medium · **Area:** Central docs — frontend stories · **Related:** `FE-011`, `FE-016`, `FE-018`
- **Issue:** `frontend.md:213` says *"Receiving a `RedirectReceived` event … (see FE-016)"*, but FE-016 is the requester "finding a technician" spinner. The redirect story is **FE-018**.
- **Fix:** Change "(see FE-016)" → "(see FE-018)".
- **Done when:** FE-011 points to FE-018.

## BUG-004 — Phase 3 exit criterion depends on a Phase 4 endpoint

- **Status:** Fixed · **Severity:** Medium · **Area:** Central docs — execution plan · **Related:** `BE-014`, `BE-015`
- **Issue:** `execution-plan.md` Phase 3 exit criteria require *"offer visible via `GET /job-offers/pending`"*, but that endpoint is **BE-015 (Phase 4)** — it does not exist at Phase 3 completion.
- **Fix:** Reword Phase 3 exit to stop at the `JobOfferReceived` event (BE-014's deliverable); move the `/job-offers/pending` clause to Phase 4.
- **Done when:** Phase 3 exit criteria reference only Phase 3 deliverables.

## BUG-005 — `data-flow.puml` mis-wires requester status messages

- **Status:** Fixed · **Severity:** Medium · **Area:** Central docs — architecture diagram · **Related:** `data-flow.puml`, `state-machines.md`, `FE-017`
- **Issue:** `data-flow.puml:76` emits `"Almost There" (Within15Miles)` on the `/rep/arrive` → OnSite step (`:73-74`). Per `state-machines.md` and the UI brief, OnSite should read "Arrived" / "Your technician has arrived", and "Almost there" belongs on the Within-15-Miles transition (`:71`).
- **Fix:** Emit "Almost there" at the Within15Miles transition and "Arrived" on `/rep/arrive`.
- **Done when:** The puml messages match the state→message mapping in the brief / state machine.

## BUG-006 — README Skills table omits the `master` skill

- **Status:** Open · **Severity:** Medium · **Area:** Central docs — README · **Related:** `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- **Issue:** `README.md:54-64` lists 9 skills and omits `master`, which `CLAUDE.md:126-137` and the filesystem include.
- **Fix:** Add a `master` row to the README Skills table.
- **Done when:** The README Skills table lists all 10 skills.

## BUG-007 — Existing scripts are undocumented

- **Status:** Open · **Severity:** Medium · **Area:** Central docs — CLAUDE.md / README · **Related:** `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `scripts/`
- **Issue:** `scripts/local/test-all.sh`, `scripts/local/test-simulator.sh`, and `scripts/utils/mark-story-complete.sh` exist but appear in neither the CLAUDE.md Commands section nor the README.
- **Fix:** Document the three scripts.
- **Done when:** All real scripts are listed in the command documentation.

## BUG-008 — `ship-it` scope contradiction (CLAUDE.md vs the skill)

- **Status:** Open · **Severity:** Medium · **Area:** Central docs — CLAUDE.md / ship-it skill · **Related:** `CLAUDE.md:137`, `ship-it/SKILL.md`
- **Issue:** CLAUDE.md says ship-it "lands all pending local changes on main", but the skill scopes itself to *out-of-pipeline* changes and routes story work to `/master`.
- **Fix:** Update CLAUDE.md:137 to "lands out-of-pipeline changes (docs/config/housekeeping); story commits/PRs go through `/master`."
- **Done when:** CLAUDE.md matches the skill's stated scope.

## BUG-009 — `story-implementor` hardcodes `dotnet test`

- **Status:** Open · **Severity:** Medium · **Area:** Central — AI pipeline (story-implementor) · **Related:** `story-implementor/AGENT.md`
- **Issue:** Lines 37, 145, 154 use bare `dotnet test`, but the agent elsewhere mandates a "repo-appropriate test command" with per-repo paths (`:134,178,214-220`) — wrong scope for Frontend/Simulator.
- **Fix:** Replace bare `dotnet test` at 37/145/154 with "the repo-appropriate test command (see Repo-Specific Test Commands)."
- **Done when:** No bare `dotnet test` remains where a repo-specific command is required.

## BUG-010 — Dispatcher force-release endpoint is under-documented

- **Status:** Open · **Severity:** Medium · **Area:** Central docs — UI brief / system-overview · **Related:** `BE-007`, `BUG-002`/`FE-022`, `ui-design-brief.md`, `system-overview.puml`
- **Issue:** `POST /vehicles/{id}/force-release` (BE-007, `data-flow.puml:212`) is absent from the UI brief's endpoint references and the system-overview endpoint group; only the rep self-release `/vehicles/{id}/release` is surfaced.
- **Fix:** Document the dispatcher `force-release` endpoint in the brief and system-overview, distinct from rep `release`. (FE consumer story is tracked by `BUG-002`.)
- **Done when:** force-release appears in the brief + system-overview endpoint references.

## BUG-011 — Inconsistent commit/PR attribution conventions

- **Status:** Open · **Severity:** Low · **Area:** Central — AI pipeline (story-pr, ship-it) · **Related:** `story-pr/AGENT.md`, `ship-it/SKILL.md`
- **Issue:** story-pr commit trailer = `Co-Authored-By: Claude Code <noreply@anthropic.com>`; ship-it PR body = `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]`; story-pr PR body has no attribution line — conventions disagree.
- **Fix:** Choose one attribution convention for commit trailers and one for PR bodies; apply consistently to story-pr and ship-it.
- **Done when:** All commit/PR templates use the same attribution.

## BUG-012 — `BUG-`/`fix/` branch handling incomplete downstream of master

- **Status:** Open · **Severity:** Low · **Area:** Central — AI pipeline · **Related:** `story-planner`, `story-implementor`, `story-pr`
- **Issue:** `master` / `story-evaluator` carry the `BUG-`→Repo/Area resolution and `fix/` branch convention, but `story-planner` (arch-doc table), `story-implementor`, and `story-pr` only show `feature/<BE-…>` examples and no `fix/` / Repo-Area note.
- **Fix:** Add one-line `BUG-`/`fix/` notes to those three agents.
- **Done when:** All pipeline agents handle `BUG-` consistently.

## BUG-013 — CLAUDE.md "Persona" wording implies a section that doesn't exist

- **Status:** Open · **Severity:** Low · **Area:** Central docs — CLAUDE.md · **Related:** `CLAUDE.md:148`, all `AGENT.md`, `validate-ai-system`
- **Issue:** `CLAUDE.md:148` lists "**Persona**" as a required AGENT.md section, implying a `## Persona` header; agents use an unlabeled paragraph, and `validate-ai-system` checks for a paragraph.
- **Fix:** Reword `CLAUDE.md:148` to "a persona paragraph" (or add `## Persona` headers to all 5 agents).
- **Done when:** CLAUDE.md wording matches the agents and the validator.

## BUG-014 — CLAUDE.md `docs/stories/` description omits files

- **Status:** Open · **Severity:** Low · **Area:** Central docs — CLAUDE.md · **Related:** `CLAUDE.md:79`
- **Issue:** The `docs/stories/` directory description lists the backlog + `bug.md` + execution plan but omits `parallel-tracks.md` and `README.md`.
- **Fix:** Add `parallel-tracks.md` and `README.md` to the description (or generalize the wording).
- **Done when:** The description reflects the directory's actual contents.

## BUG-015 — Stale `.gitkeep` files in populated script directories

- **Status:** Open · **Severity:** Low · **Area:** Central — scripts · **Related:** `scripts/local/.gitkeep`, `scripts/utils/.gitkeep`
- **Issue:** Both directories now contain real scripts, so the `.gitkeep` placeholders are obsolete.
- **Fix:** Remove `scripts/local/.gitkeep` and `scripts/utils/.gitkeep`.
- **Done when:** Both `.gitkeep` files are gone.
